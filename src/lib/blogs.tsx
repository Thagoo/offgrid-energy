            Sunlight Power 101: The Photovoltaic Effect
          </h1>
          <p className=" md:mt-6 mt-3">
            At the heart of every solar panel lies a marvel of science called
            the photovoltaic effect. This fascinating phenomenon explains how
            light energy is converted into electrical energy. Here&apos;s how it
            works:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-4 py-4">
            <li>
              Photons and Electrons: Sunlight is made up of tiny packets of
              energy called photons.
            </li>
            <li>
              Colliding with Atoms: When sunlight strikes the specially designed
              material within a solar panel (typically silicon), the photons
              collide with the atoms in the material.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exciting Electrons: This collision disrupts the arrangement of
              electrons in the atoms. It excites some electrons, providing them
              with enough energy to break free from their usual positions within
              the material.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating a Flow: These freed electrons are like tiny charged
              particles wanting to escape. The solar panel is designed with an
              internal electric field that acts like a gentle push, guiding
              these freed electrons in a specific direction. This directed flow
              of electrons creates an electric current – the magic ingredient
              that makes solar power possible!

            Inside a Solar Panel: A Symphony of Light and Electrons
          </h1>
          <p className="md:mt-6 mt-3">
            Solar panels are not just a single piece of material basking in the
            sun. They are intricate assemblies of numerous photovoltaic cells
            working together to generate electricity. Here&apos;s a closer look
            at the components:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-4 py-4">
            <li>
              Silicon Wafers: The heart of each photovoltaic cell is a thin
              slice of silicon, a semiconductor material well-suited for the
              photovoltaic effect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Protective Layers: These silicon wafers are sandwiched between
              layers of protective materials like glass and encapsulants. These
              layers shield the delicate silicon from harsh weather elements and
              ensure the long-term durability of the panel.
            </li>
            <li>
              Electrical Connections: Each cell is electrically connected to its
              neighbors using conductive materials. This creates a network
              within the panel that allows the collected current from individual
              cells to flow together and generate a stronger overall current.
            </li>
            <li>
              Frame and Mounting: The entire assembly is housed within a sturdy
              frame that provides structural support and allows the panel to be
              securely mounted on a rooftop or other suitable location.
            </li>
